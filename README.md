# Assignment #2 Repository for Vikram Fielding-Singh

This repository includes simulated data and a brief analysis file per the instructions for Assignment 2.

The raw data is a csv file for `cohort` (located in the in the `raw-data` folder) includes 5,000 observations with variables `smoke`, `female`, `age`, `cardiac`, and `cost`.

The analysis examines whether smoking is significantly associated with cost. First, general descriptive statistics are generated. Then some figures are used to display the relationships between two variables. The table and figure show that cost is higher in smokers. A linear regression model is then fit, adjusting for age, female, cardiac, and smoke. In the adjusted linear regression model, smoke is associated with 542 [95% CI 526 to 558] of additional cost.
